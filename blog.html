<div class="post-bodycopy clearfix"><p>In case you missed our last newsletter, <strong>Dustin DeJong</strong> is our new youth and children’s director! He begins this Sunday. Dustin’s married to Lori and they’re parents to Peyton (7) and Colby (6) and expect another boy in late August. Both are long time Tucsonans who’re excited to call the Oasis home. I’m thrilled to have the DeJongs join us and to have Dustin partner with me in serving our gracious congregation!</p>
<p>Hope and I decided to split up our <strong>vacation</strong> this summer so I could prepare for taking the youth to Fuge (Dustin will join us). We’ll take off a couple of weeks later this summer, but we just returned from a short trip to Florida to celebrate my parents’ 50-year wedding anniversary. We were joined by my parents, my brother and his family, and my sister and her family.</p>
<p>It probably comes as no surprise that the highlight of the trip involved <strong>saltwater fishing</strong>. I took the girls inshore fishing twice. I paid for the first one, but since we caught nothing but catfish, the guide took us the following morning without charging us. Captain Clint was kind, patient and thoughtful. He took time to teach the girls to fish and never raised his voice. He also threw the cast-net like a pro.</p>
<p>We didn’t catch much, but we had a blast on the water. We saw dolphin, sharks, starfish, conch shells, barracuda and a puffer fish. We even fished from sandbars in the middle of the bay. There’s something about being on a boat that makes me come alive. Catching a couple of fish didn’t hurt, either. I took a few moments on the boat to <strong>thank God</strong> for the beauty around me and the opportunity to do something I deeply love. God is kind.</p>
<p>The second fishing trip was followed by the most difficult part of the trip—<strong>family conflict</strong>. It was ugly. Worse still, it didn’t get resolved by bedtime. So, the next day I spoke with my siblings and parents separately. My longing was to do everything in my power to resolve the conflict before it turned into irreparable bitterness. I followed the admonition of Paul in Romans 12.18: <em>If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.</em></p>
<p>I asked <strong>forgiveness</strong> from some and confronted others with how they hurt me or others, offering forgiveness to those who wounded me. I found myself submitting to the very sermon I had recorded for Memorial Day weekend. It wasn’t pleasant, but it was good. Friendship can only exist between people who’re committed to do the hard stuff necessary for reconciliation. So, the trip was good—very good—but I wouldn’t exactly call it a vacation :-)</p>
<p>Sunday we continued our series, <em>God’s Blueprint for Relationships</em>. Pastor Rod Hugen addressed <strong><em>Honoring Our Spiritual Leaders</em></strong>. If you missed the message, you’ll find it <a href="http://oasisritaranch.com/resources/message-series-archive/">here</a>. I’m excited about this series, and I hope you are, too.</p>

<div class="post-bodycopy clearfix"><p>After several face-to-face meetings, conversations with references, and much prayer, I believe we have our next staff person to oversee youth and children. Since he’ll be new to the Oasis, his position will be <strong>youth and children’s director</strong>. If directors approve, and if he’s as good a fit as I believe he’ll be, we’ll probably ordain him as our next pastor in December or January. Since the directors must still approve of him, I’ll hold off introducing him until next week’s newsletter. In the meantime, I’m really excited about bringing him aboard and I’m certain you’ll fall in love with his family, too.</p>
<p>I’m excited to announce that our own Annie Valencia wants to serve us as a part-time, <strong>college intern</strong> to help us make disciples at Pima and Oasis. Annie just graduated from the University of Arizona and will begin work on her master’s degree at UA in the fall. Annie’s very qualified for the position and would do a fantastic job. I’m confident the directors will approve! Over the summer Annie will raise support, so you may be hearing from her soon. In the meantime, continue to pray for us as we continue to search for a male <strong>college intern</strong> to help us, too.</p>
<p>If you haven’t found a <strong>home church</strong> yet, please check out a few (you’ll find the details on page two). I’m confident there’s a home church that will fit you and your schedule. As you visit each one, ask God to lead you to the one that’s right for you. My prayer is that you’ll commit to the home church where you can best serve and grow.</p>
<p>As I mentioned last week, we need more <strong>volunteers </strong>for nursery and junior church now that we’re growing. In fact, we just added a second junior church classroom to the second service on Sunday. One of the advantages of having two services is that you can occasionally serve in one service while always attending worship in the other service (the one you prefer). So, if you attend the first service, please consider volunteering once a month in the second service (or vice-versa). You’ll spend more time at the Oasis once a month, but you’ll still hear the message, experience the worship service and see your friends. We could really use the help!</p>
<p>Keep taking pictures in front of our sign and post them to Facebook with the hashtag: <strong>#oasishasland</strong>. You’re helping us create a buzz on social media!</p>
<p>Sunday we continued our series through Luke with 7.18-35. If you missed the message, you’ll find it <a href="http://oasisritaranch.com/resources/message-series-archive/">here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Jesus doesn’t want us to condemn others, but we do have to “judge” or <strong>evaluate leaders, people, and ideas</strong> all the time. We learned that discrimination is necessary—we must constantly choose between competing candidates and ideas. So, what should be our guide? How can we “judge” in a way that honors God? Check out this week’s message for more details…<b></b></p>

<div class="post-bodycopy clearfix"><p>We continue to look for a <strong>student pastor</strong> to oversee youth and children. Last week I met with a young man I hope will soon take over many of Tory’s duties. The directors must still approve of him, but you’ll get a chance to meet him soon. I’m really excited about bringing him aboard and I’m certain you’ll fall in love with his family.</p>
<p>We also continue to look for <strong>college interns</strong> (one male and one female) to help us make disciples at Pima and Oasis. Last week I met with one of our single adults who’s considering this position. I’m praying she’ll join our team, too, because she’s qualified for the position and would do a fantastic job. Even if she turns down the position though, I’m hopeful God will bring us the people we need to help us transform Tucson one person at a time.</p>
<p>On page three you’ll find details about the decision our directors made not to acquire the <strong>modular building</strong>…</p>
<p>If you haven’t found a <strong>home church</strong> yet, please check out a few (you’ll find the details for all eight on page two).

<p>In this passage Jesus demonstrates that <strong>he isn’t limited</strong> by personal prejudice, physical distance, what people think of him, or even death. The only limits are the ones we place on him by not praying, stepping out in faith, or obeying him.</p>
<p>Do you <strong>limit Jesus</strong> by refusing to trust him? Are you more worried about what people think of you than what Jesus wants to do around you? Do you avoid walking into conflict or hurt? I invite you to do some soul-searching this week to discover how you limit what God wants to do through you.</p>

<div class="post-bodycopy clearfix"><p>The last two weeks have been difficult for me. <strong>Tory’s resignation</strong> was a surprise that left Annette and me scrambling to make sure we or someone else takes responsibility for Tory’s duties. He leaves a huge hole. Over the last four year’s I’ve shared more and more leadership with Tory. I felt like we were both pulling the same rope in the same direction. That fact alone encouraged my heart and lightened my load.</p>
<p>Now that’s gone, and so is Tory. I’ve treasured his friendship, as well as his partnership, which makes this even more painful. I’m sure from Tory’s perspective leaving the Oasis “isn’t personal,” but it feels deeply personal to me—like rejection—and I’m <strong>grieving his departure</strong>. I’ve lost a friend and the Oasis has lost a leader. The enemy won this round. For more information on how to grieve, see last Sunday’s message below.</p>
<p>Please <strong>continue to pray</strong> for Tory, Judy, and their kids. They’re going through a very difficult time and we long to see God put them back together, both individually and corporately. Tory and Judy need repentance and healing. God’s power is sufficient to bring restoration to each of them and even to their marriage. Pray the enemy won’t successfully use shame to keep them from finding community, because they cannot endure this journey alone. They need a spiritual family now more than ever to help them heal. I only wish it could have been the Oasis.</p>
<p>On Sunday we commissioned the leaders of our eight <strong>home churches</strong>. I’m deeply indebted to these men and women who’ve chosen to care for souls at the Oasis. If you haven’t joined a home church, yet, please pray about which one God would have you join. Ask God to lead you to the home church where you can offer the most and receive the most. Check out several different home churches until you find the one that best fits you.</p>
<p>I appreciate those of you who’ve taken pictures in front of our sign and posted them on social media with the hashtag: <strong>#oasishasland</strong>. You’re helping us create a buzz on Facebook. We’ll continue to post your pictures here and on Sundays.</p>
<p>Our directors are close to making a decision about whether or not we should accept a large, <strong>modular building</strong>. Please continue to pray for wisdom. For details, read the article on page three.</p>
<p>Sunday we continued our series through Luke with Luke 6.12-16. If you missed the message, you’ll find it <a href="http://oasisritaranch.com/resources/message-series-archive/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We examined the five marks of a disciple (follower) of Jesus and the <strong>Master’s plan of evangelism</strong>. We learned that Jesus’ method was simple: Choose a small group of men, spend time developing them, and send them out to reproduce themselves. That should be our strategy, too.</p>

<div class="post-bodycopy clearfix"><p>Our fifteenth annual <strong>Easter egg hunt</strong> is THIS Saturday, March 26. We need volunteers for setup, concessions, facepainting, registration, crafts, games, egg hiding, the Easter bunny, breaking down and more. We serve over 800 kids and their families, making this one of the two biggest events in Purple Heart Park every year. Our community often recognizes our congregation as the group that hosts this event and we get compliments all the time. So, help us make this year’s event our best ever by joining us Saturday! If you’d like to help set up, arrive between 8.00 – 8.30am. Registration starts at 10.00am, the hunts take place from 11.00am-1.00pm, and we finish cleaning up by 2.00pm. Don’t miss it!</p>
<p>To each of you who’ve taken pictures in front of our sign and posted them on social media with the hastag: <strong>#oasishasland</strong>, “thank you!” You’re helping us create a buzz on Facebook! We’ll continue to post your pictures here and on Sunday mornings as we get the word out to our friends and community that we’re here.</p>
<p>Our directors continue to pray about whether or not we should accept a large, <strong>modular building</strong>. For details, read the article on page three.</p>
<p>The Beta course ends this week. I’ve enjoyed giving half of the talks, including each of the three messages this week. As much as I love Beta, I’m even more excited about what comes next. Next week, we’ll launch eight or nine new <strong>home churches</strong>. Our desire is to make sure each home church is healthy from day one. That means having the right leaders, committed apprentices, and a missional purpose. Please pray about the home church God would have you join. Pray for God to use you and your gifts to build up the body of Christ that best fits your gifts.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, we’ve developed part-time, <strong>college ministry internships</strong> to recruit young people to help us reach Pima-East. We’re trying to recruit college students (and graduates) who would raise their financial support in order to work for Oasis (at no charge to us). We’ve had very few people show interest, even though we’re on the career site for ten universities in the southwest and have utilized our networks at Pima, UA Cru, UA Christian Challenge, and ASU Christian Challenge. Please continue to pray that God would send us at least two, sharp young people willing to serve as missionaries to college students.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed leading Cru students (including three from Oasis) on a <strong>three-day mission trip</strong> to ASU last week. Students spent time building relationships, sharing the gospel, worshipping with students on campus, and hanging out with one another. It was a blast letting these students taste what it means to be the body of Christ.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we kicked off Holy Week with a Palm Sunday/ Good Friday message on Romans 5.1-11. If you missed the message, you can listen to it <a href="http://oasisritaranch.com/resources/message-series-archive/">here</a>.</p>

<div class="post-bodycopy clearfix"><p>Join us this Saturday for the <strong>Beta retreat</strong> on Mt. Lemmon (Cypress picnic area). This is only our second Beta retreat and we host it just once every three (3) years. We’ll discuss Christian baptism, Christian community, and growing in the Christian faith. We begin at 8.15am and end at 5.45pm. In addition to several talks, we’ll enjoy breakfast and lunch together. When we’re done, we’ll drive down and enjoy dinner together in Tucson. The cost is only $12 (not including dinner). If you haven’t registered for the retreat but want to join us, just call me ASAP (270.2969) and let me know you’re coming. It’s going to be a blast!</p>

Our community often recognizes our congregation as the group that hosts this event and we get compliments all the time. So, help us make this year’s event our best ever!</p>
<p>I’m excited about an opportunity we have to acquire a large, complimentary, <strong>modular building</strong>. For details, read the article on page three.</p>
<p>We’re halfway through the Beta course. I’m thrilled to see all the new faces attending Beta and I’m sad we’re almost done (we’ll be finished by Easter). After Beta, we’ll launch between eight and ten <strong>home churches</strong>. Hopefully, most if not all Beta groups will continue as home churches. Some groups have leaders willing to remain on after Beta. Other leaders aren’t sure they’ll continue as leaders. So, we’ll need plenty of leaders and assistant leaders by Easter. If you’re interested in helping lead one of these groups, please let us know. We need willing hearts, and we need them by the end of March!</p>
<p>We’re also looking ahead to the future of our college ministry. Our young adults are one of the fastest growing groups within Oasis, both numerically and spiritually. In the past, we’ve relied on help from Cru interns and part-time staff. That will disappear in June. So, we’ve developed part-time <strong>college ministry internships</strong>. We’re trying to recruit college students (and graduates) to consider raising their financial support in order to work for Oasis at Pima-East. They’ll do the same kind of work Jesse’s doing (and Miranda did), but they’ll work for us rather than Cru. Pray that God sends a few, sharp young people our way who’re willing to serve as missionaries to college students.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we continued our series in Luke with 5.1-11. If you missed the message, you can listen to it <a href="http://oasisritaranch.com/resources/message-series-archive/">here</a>.</p>

<div class="post-bodycopy clearfix"><p>I’ve enjoyed spending time with Oasis members and attenders on <strong>Beta</strong> nights. Each home is averaging nearly 30 people, including over a dozen people who’re relatively new to Oasis. The food has been excellent, but the conversations have been even better. I’ve also enjoyed revisiting these important topics, and I’m already looking forward to next week!</p>
<p>Continue to pray for <strong>Jen Noel</strong> as she undergoes chemotherapy treatments. Pray for healing, endurance, and strength for the Noels. Also, continue to pray for Derek Hugen (right), Rod’s youngest son. He’s still in a chemically-induced coma as he slowly recovers from a virus that nearly killed him a week ago. Pray for healing and for comfort for Rod and Kathy.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we continued our series in Luke with 4:14-30. If you missed the message, you can listen to it <a href="http://oasisritaranch.com/resources/message-series-archive/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Luke gives us a glimpse into the kind of message Jesus preached in the synagogues of Galilee and Judea. After reading from Isaiah, Jesus sat down, stared at the congregation, and announced that this reading had been fulfilled in their hearing. Jesus declared <strong>Jubilee</strong>.</p>
<p>Jubilee was supposed to be celebrated once every 49 or 50 years. Jewish slaves would be set free, debts would be forgiven, property would be returned, and the land would lie fallow—only Isael didn’t recognized the year of Jubilee because it was <strong>too radical</strong>.</p>
<p>Then Jesus came along and declared that Jubilee had begun! The <strong>freedom</strong> and joy their ancestors had longed for was finally here. Jesus, the Son of God, would set the captives free, open the eyes of the blind, and preach good news to the poor. Because of his unique identity, he would not only proclaim Jubilee, Jesus would make it happen.</p>
<p>This message fell on <strong>deaf ears</strong>. The people of Nazareth were impressed by their favorite son, but they weren’t moved by his words. Jesus’ message didn’t seem to apply to them. They didn’t view themselves as poor, needy, blind, or imprisoned. Jesus’ words were nice. They were bold, but they didn’t apply.</p>
<p>So Jesus told them he would go to those who recognized their need. He would go to the <strong>desperate</strong>. Jesus would go to Gentiles. When he said this, his hometown elders took him outside and tried to throw him off a cliff. Wow! Things went sideways quickly.</p>
<p>The same is true for us. We have good news for those who recognize their need. When we share it, some will <strong>reject</strong> our message and others will <strong>welcome</strong> it, just as they did with Jesus. The former will break our hearts, but the latter will make it all worthwhile when they join our forever family and enter the Kingdom of God. So keep sharing it!</p>

<li>Hope leads one on Fridays from 9.00 – 10.30am in her home (9571 E Paseo San Bernardo). The topic is prayer in Luke’s Gospel. It’s for women only. For more info, call Hope at 955-3480.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Pastor Tory leads one on Sundays from 1.00 – 2.30pm at the church office. It meets every other week. The topic is worship, focusing on the Psalms. Anyone may participate. For more info, contact Tory at 404-0841.</li>
</ol>
<p>This week we begin the <strong>Beta course</strong>. We’re expecting 100+ people to participate! Over the next 18 months, this is by far the best course we’ll offer to invite an unchurched friend to attend. The topics include: life after death, why God allows suffering, Christianity and other religions, the Christian view of sex and marriage, the Christian view of homosexuality, the new age movement, Science and the Bible, and the distinctly Christian view of God. For more info on Beta, check out page two!</p>
<p>We continue to make progress on our land. Check out <strong>page three</strong> for land and capital campaign updates.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we continued our series in Luke with 3:21-38. If you missed the message, you can listen to it <a href="http://oasisritaranch.com/resources/message-series-archive/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this passage, Luke explores the question, “Who is Jesus?” The Father himself gives a clear answer to Jesus and to us: <strong>Jesus is his Son</strong>. If that’s true, Jesus deserves our total allegiance. Others may get our admiration, but Jesus deserves more. He deserves absolute obedience.</p>
<p>Jesus’ genealogy tells us that <strong>he came to rescue us all</strong>. If both of these statements are true, the world needs to know. That’s why we share our faith and support missionaries. People need to hear the good news. So, take advantage of Beta and bring a friend with you this week. If you can, offer to pick them up and bring them with you.</p>
<p>If Jesus needed <strong>the Father to confirm his identity</strong>, so do I. I need to let God alone define me. I need to let the Spirit empower me to love God and others well. I cannot do this unless I trust God for my identity and the Spirit for my success.</p>

<div class="post-bodycopy clearfix"><p>As I’ve mentioned several times, 2016 is the <strong>year of the Bible</strong> at Oasis. We encourage you to participate in one or more Bible studies this year. The only requirements are that you belong to a Beta group or home church (when Beta’s over) and that each Bible study have a one-semester life span (or less). Here are four that have just started or will begin soon:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rhoda Folkers just began one on Tuesday nights at 7.00pm in Dunkin Donuts. The topic is the “One Another” passages in the New Testament. Anyone may attend. For more info, contact Rhoda at 762-8002.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>I began one last Friday morning from 9.00 – 10.30am in Dunkin Donuts. The topic is prayer in Luke’s Gospel. It’s for men only. For more info, contact me at 270-2969.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>This Friday, Hope begins one from 9.00 – 10.30am in our home (9571 E Paseo San Bernardo). The topic is prayer in Luke’s Gospel. It’s for women only. For more info, call Hope at 955-3480.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>On Sunday, January 31, Tory will begin one from 1.00 – 2.30pm at the church office. The topic will be worship, focusing on the Psalms. Anyone may participate. For more info, contact Tory at 404-0841.</li>
</ol>
<p>This Sunday we kick off Beta with our <strong>Beta banquet</strong> at 6.00pm in Empire High School. The meal will be catered by Carmen (formerly of El Molinito’s). We’ve already turned in our final count, but we left a little room for guests. So, if you want to bring a guest, you can still get him/her/them a ticket on Sunday. Beta’s the perfect course for friends who don’t yet know Jesus, so please feel free to invite as many as you can. For more info on Beta, check out page two!</p>
<p>We continue to make progress on our land. Check out <strong>page three</strong> for land and capital campaign updates.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we resumed our series in Luke with 2:41-52. If you missed the message, you can listen to it <a href="http://oasisritaranch.com/resources/message-series-archive/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We surveyed the only biblical story of Jesus’ childhood. We learned that at age twelve, Jesus already realized he was more than a prophet. He was conscious of being the unique <strong>Son of God</strong>. Though he’s entirely human (he even obeyed his parents), he’s also much more.</p>
<p>Jesus reminds us that our <strong>highest allegiance</strong> is to God. That loyalty supercedes all others—employers, friends, children, parents, and even spouses. God alone deserves our absolute obedience. His mission is our mission.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should be <strong>patient and prepare</strong> ourselves for the mission God may give us. His timing is perfect. So, when we find ourselves waiting, we should do so actively. We prepare for the mission by spending time at Jesus’ feet.</p>

<div class="post-bodycopy clearfix"><p>I hope your new year is off to a wonderful start! I took a little time off between Christmas Eve and Monday, and now I’m feeling re-energized and ready to help lead Oasis into 2016! I’m thrilled with how God worked in our community last year and I’m hopeful that the future will be even more exciting! We’ll talk about both in more detail this Sunday during our annual <strong>State of the Oasis</strong>. I’m already working on this year’s slide show.</p>
<p>As I mentioned a couple of months ago, 2016 will be the <strong>year of the Bible</strong> at the Oasis. I’m encouraging you to lead and/or participate in one or more Bible studies. The only requirements are that every participant belong to a Beta group or home church (when Beta’s over) and that each Bible study should have a one-semester life span (or less). I’ll lead one for men on Fridays from 9.00 – 10.30am at Dunkin Donuts beginning January 15. We’ll explore prayer in the Gospel of Luke, especially as Jesus modeled and explained it. So if you’re a man, your invited! Ladies, if you’re interested in leading or participating in a Bible study, let me know…</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to preparing and developing our land. As you’ll read on <strong>page three</strong>, we’re working with an architect, consultant and sign company about the next steps. We’ll keep you updated this year on page three about what’s going on with our land and the balance of our savings account. I’m proud to say that we continue making our loan payments along with the additional principal payment without borrowing anything from savings. We’re still on track to pay off the land entirely in five years…</p>
<p>The biggest event on the calendar right now is our <strong>Beta banquet</strong>. You’ll see a huge invitation on page two. We’re charging $1 for tickets and we’re asking members to pay for their own, as well as for their guest. This Sunday you’ll have a chance to purchase a ticket before, during, or after the service. Selling tickets allows us to keep track of how many are coming, so we won’t have way too much or way too little food (catered by El Molinito’s). So, come prepared this Sunday to buy your tickets!</p>
<p>In case you missed it, last month we shared one way we can serve children and families in need. <strong>Care Portal</strong> is an electronic system that connects those in need with churches who want to help. If you didn’t see the video, you can watch it <a href="https://vimeo.com/149041911">here</a>. We’ve enrolled our church and established a Facebook group to notify people of needs. If you want to be added to the group, send us an email. We’ve already helped our first family and I look forward to how God will use us to make a difference in Tucson.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Pastor Tory shared how we can start 2016 the right way with <strong>Psalm 51</strong>. If you missed the message, you can listen to it <a href="http://oasisritaranch.com/resources/message-series-archive/">here</a>.</p>

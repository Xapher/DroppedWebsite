					<h1>Who/What is Oasis?</h1>
					<p>
						The Oasis is a network of home churches (micro-churches) in southeast Tucson whose mission is to turn unchurched people into fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ. We cooperate with one another to develop new and 
						existing leaders, host a regular (Sunday) gathering for corporate worship and learning, and fulfill the Great Commandment and the Great Commission.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our core values (our personality) include intimacy, community and amateur leadership. Our home churches don't simply study the Bible - they apply it life by practicing authentic relationships based on love. They do
						this by making a commitment to love Jesus, love one another, and love those God places in their path in order to produce spiritual leaders for the kingdom of God - not professional Christians, but ordinary followers of 
						Jesus who change the world. For more information, go to the home church section of our site.

					What we believe.
				</h1>
					<p>
						At the Oasis, we major on the majors.  That is, we concentrate on the central beliefs of the Christian faith.  We agree with the historical position of the Church on all of the major tenets of our faith.
						<ul>
							<li>
								The Bible is God's Word to us.
							</li>
							<li>
								There is one true and living God in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
							</li>
							<li>
								We are all separated from God because we have rejected His love and authority.
							</li>
							<li>
								God has graciously acted in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ to restore us to Himself.
							</li>
							<li>
								Jesus established the Church and filled it with His Holy Spirit to continue His rescue mission on earth.
							</li>
							<li>
								Jesus will return personally and visibly to decide the eternal destiny of all people, based on their response to Him.

							</li>
						</ul>
						Perhaps a better statement of faith is the Apostles' Creed, repeated by believers of every major tradition for centuries: We believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. We believe in Jesus Christ, God's only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate,  was crucified, died, and was buried; he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again; he ascended into heaven, he is seated at the right hand of the Father, and he will come again to judge the living and the dead. We believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
